# Building Layouts

What's the point?
- Widgets are classes used to build UIs.
- Widgets are used for both layout and UI elements.
- Compose simple widgets to build complex widgets.

Flutter布局的核心在于控件。Flutter中，几乎所有都是控件，包括布局模型。还有一些不可见元素，比如
rows, columns和grids。

What's the point?
- Row and Column are two of the most commonly used layout patterns.
- Row and Column each take a child widget.
- A child widget can itself be a Row, Column, other complex widget.
- You can specify how a Row or Column aligns its children, both vertically and horizontally.
- You can stretch or constrain child widgets.
- You can specify how child widgets use the Row's or Column's available space.
